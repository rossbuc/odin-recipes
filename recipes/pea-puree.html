    <h1>Pea Puree</h1>

    <p>
        This recipe is another really easy one that works as a great side for dinner parties. I tend to not bother with fresh peas and use frozen garden peas or petit pois.

        The butter quantity is more of a guideline and generally I ususally add until the puree tastes buttery enough. The same goes for the star anise as it's more to taste than a set amount.
