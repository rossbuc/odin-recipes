    <p>
        This recipe is a great weeknight comforter which uses a few simple ingredients for one indulgent and tasty pasta treat! The star of the show is really the fennel and we want to try and bring out that anisead flavour as much as possible. Most of the ingredients you should be able to get from your regular supermarket but the fennel might require a trip to your nearest green grocers!

        For the pasta I generally use fresh tagliatelle however any long pasta, such as linguine or spaghetti will suit this dish nicely. Should you choose to use dried pasta take care when adding pasta water as there will not be the same startch content and so the sauce could turn out runny.
