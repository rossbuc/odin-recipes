    <p>
        This is a great side for any dinner party main you have planned for the evening, it's quick, easy, and delicious! There are numerous flavourings and  variations you can add to this dish such as truffle oil or infusing the carrots with star anise when boiling them.

        To get a really silky smooth puree you could pass it through a fine siv, but to get things done quickly you can just stick it in a food processor and  blend it for a while until smooth, or use a hand blander to the same effect.
